# Google colab

In this project a selfcontained notebook was created using Google colab.
The data was taken from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/m1q8ia/official_2020_fi_survey_results/). The purpose of the project is reveal the benefits of using a google colab notebook to present results to stakeholders. In this brief example I showed how the social variables are not representative of the US population.

The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EfdVUrKCHM2dIugvxpCWXbrpy4A8DJyW?authuser=0#scrollTo=hvBIbxsWyz3p).
